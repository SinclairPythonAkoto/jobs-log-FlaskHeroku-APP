THOUGHT PROCESS DOCUMENTATION

After successfully loading the Flask Heroku template onto my repository, I changed some of the data in app.py & the contemt of the templates folder.

The documentation of my thought process is available below.

TP #1
* Delete old files and change python file
* In the python file import os & psycopg2
* Write the same code as I did for the walk-through Heroku app I completed.

TP #2
* The above didn't work, so delete the files and start with basic 'Hello World' route to test if it works.
